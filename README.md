# sandbox

This is a collection of snippets and pieces of code that have accumulated for years, pulled together into a single project with tests.

You can expect that it will grow over time, as it's more convenient for me to put the Java bits in one place. In addition, I will in
the future translate the Java 8 materials to Java 11 or later.

You can find the following in here:

  - cli-8: A Java 8 Maven project that builds a stand-alone executable JAR that does not much, accompanied by tests.
